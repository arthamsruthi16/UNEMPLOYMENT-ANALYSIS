# UNEMPLOYMENT-ANALYSIS
Unemployment Analysis in India using Python – A data science project with visualization of unemployment trends, labour participation, and state-wise insights.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Unemployment Analysis in India** using Python. The dataset contains information about unemployment rate, employment, and labour participation across different states/regions in India. The analysis includes visualizations to understand trends, correlations, and comparisons between urban and rural areas.

Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate, which is the percentage of unemployed people in the total labor force. During Covid-19, unemployment rates increased sharply, making this an important topic for data analysis.
